# VirtualPet

## Do you remember Cyberpet? Tamagotchi? Digimon? Petz? Virtual pets like these were born in 1996. With your help, they will be reborn. <h2>

Virtual Toys, Inc. wants you to build the next iteration of virtual pets to market to adults who enjoy updated versions of the toys and games they played in their youth. This game will be like the virtual pets of 1996...but so much more. It’s Virtual Pets Amok!

Our pets are organic or robotic! They are housed in a shelter and cared for by you. They have unique personalities. They can be adopted.

Virtual Toys, Inc. provides:

* Development of a C# console application by a team that practices agile methodology, utilizes test driven design, and values clean code
* An interactive user interface
* A player can enter the game, play as long as they’d like, and leave the game when they want
* Player’s choice of organic or robotic pets
* Ability for players to admit pets into the shelter or adopt them
* Ability for players to see a list of all pets in the shelter
* Ability for players to see the current status of pets, such as hunger, boredom, and health
* Ability for players to interact with one pet or multiple pets, such as feed, play, and take to doctor
* As players interact with pets, the pet’s status changes
* As "time" ticks by, the pet's status changes negatively. The passing of time is measured by how often the player interacts with the program.
